## KMeans-MakeBlob-Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using synthetic data generated with make_blob from the sklearn.datasets module. K-Means is a widely-used unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data points into groups.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository : `git clone https://github.com/sOR-o/KMeans-MakeBlob-Implementation.git`
2. Install Dependencies : `pip install -r req.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook/lab or Python script to see K-Means clustering in action.

You can use the provided code as a starting point for your own K-Means clustering projects. Feel free to modify and expand upon this codebase to fit your specific needs. If you'd like to contribute to this project, please open an issue or submit a pull request. 

Contributions are welcome!
